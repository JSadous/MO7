Difference Between React, ReactJS, and React Native

- React and ReactJS are the same.
- ReactJS is just a more specific name for React.
- It is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces for web applications.
- React helps create reusable components and manage state effectively.

- React Native is a separate framework based on React.
- It is used to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript.
- Unlike React for web, React Native renders native mobile UI elements instead of HTML.

 - Use React or ReactJS when building web apps. 
  - Use React Native when building mobile apps.

 Is React a framework or a library? What is the difference?

- React is a library, not a framework.
- It focuses specifically on building user interfaces (UI) by creating reusable components.
- React handles the view layer in applications, giving developers flexibility to choose other tools for routing, state management, etc.

- A library offers specific functionality you can call when needed.
- A framework provides a complete structure and dictates how to build your app (more opinionated).

- In short:
 - React is a library because it gives flexibility and handles only part of the application (UI).
  - A framework would control more of the overall app architecture and flow.

---

Comparison: HTML vs JSX

- HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on web pages.
- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used in React that looks like HTML,
- but allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript.

- Unlike HTML, JSX requires proper syntax (e.g., using className instead of class),
- and allows embedding JavaScript expressions using {}.

- Summary:
 - JSX is similar to HTML but is used within JavaScript code in React.
  - It lets you build UI components using a familiar syntax, with more dynamic capability.

---

What makes React attractive for our case?
- React is component-based, which makes it easy to build, reuse, and manage pieces of UI.
- It efficiently updates the UI using a virtual DOM, improving performance.
- React is also widely supported, has a strong community, and integrates well with other tools.

- Summary:
 - React is a good choice because it helps build fast, modular, and maintainable user interfaces,
  - which fits well with modern web application needs.

---

What are some alternative tech stacks?

- A tech stack is the combination of tools and technologies used to build an application.
- Alternatives to the React-based stack (like MERN) include:

- MEAN: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js
- JAMstack: JavaScript, APIs, and Markup (often using frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby)
- LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (commonly used for server-rendered apps)
- Django + React or Vue: Django (Python) backend with a modern JS frontend
- Ruby on Rails + Hotwire or React

- Summary:
 - There are many tech stacks available depending on project needs.
  - Alternatives include Angular-based, server-rendered, or static site stacks.

---

Why is MERN a good choice for full development?

- MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
- It's a full-stack JavaScript solution, meaning you can use one language (JavaScript)
- across the entire application â€“ frontend, backend, and database interactions.
- Each part of the stack is open-source, well-documented, and widely supported.
- React handles the frontend, Express and Node manage the backend, and MongoDB provides a flexible NoSQL database.

- Summary:
 - MERN is a good choice because it allows full-stack development using JavaScript,
  - offers strong performance, and supports rapid development with reusable components.

Provided two mern git hub links
- https://github.com/BenElferink/mern-template
 -I find this intresting because it uses passport js for authentication

- https://github.com/SEI-Remote/decoupled-mern-jwt-auth-template-back-end
 - I find this intersting because the creator uses JWT for code clean up

# MERN Stack Application Setup Guide

## Project Structure

This guide walks through creating a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application with full CRUD functionality.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB instance
- Git for version control

---

## Backend Setup (Server)

### 1. Initialize Server Directory

- Create a new directory for your project and navigate to the server folder.
- Initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies.

### 2. Configure `package.json`

- Set up your `package.json` with the following configurations:
  - Set type to `"module"` for ES6 imports
  - Add start script with `nodemon`
  - Configure environment file loading

### 3. Install Dependencies

- Install the required packages:
  - `express` for the web server
  - `cors` for cross-origin requests
  - `mongodb` for database connection
  - `nodemon` for development server auto-restart

### 4. Environment Configuration

- Create a `config.env` file in the server directory with your MongoDB connection string and server port configuration.

### 5. Database Connection

- Create a `db` folder with `connection.js` file to establish MongoDB connection using the connection string from environment variables.

### 6. Server Setup

- Create `server.js` file to:
  - Import `express` and `cors`
  - Configure middleware for JSON parsing and CORS
  - Set up port configuration
  - Import and use route handlers
  - Start the server

### 7. API Routes

- Create a `routes` folder with `record.js` file containing:
  - `GET` route for fetching all records
  - `GET` route for fetching single record by ID
  - `POST` route for creating new records
  - `PATCH` route for updating existing records
  - `DELETE` route for removing records

---

## Frontend Setup (Client)

### 1. Create React Application

- Use Vite to create a new React application with the react template.

### 2. Install Dependencies

- Navigate to the client directory and install the base dependencies along with React Router for navigation.

### 3. Configure Tailwind CSS

- Install and configure Tailwind CSS for styling:
  - Install `tailwindcss` and its dependencies
  - Create `tailwind.config.js`
  - Configure PostCSS with tailwindcss plugin
  - Add Tailwind directives to `index.css`

### 4. Router Configuration

- Set up React Router in `main.jsx` with routes for:
  - Home page displaying record list
  - Create new record page
  - Edit existing record page

### 5. App Component

- Create the main App component that serves as the layout wrapper containing:
  - Navigation bar
  - Outlet for nested routes

### 6. Components Development

- Create `components` folder with:
  - Navbar component for navigation
  - RecordList component for displaying all records
  - Record component for creating and editing records

### 7. Backend Integration

- Implement fetch API calls in components:
  - `GET` request to fetch all records
  - `GET` request to fetch single record for editing
  - `POST` request to create new records
  - `PATCH` request to update existing records
  - `DELETE` request to remove records

---

### CRUD Operations

- Create new employee records
- Read and display all records
- Update existing records
- Delete records from database

### Frontend Features

- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

- Navigation between pages
- Dynamic form population for editing

### Backend Features

- MongoDB integration
- Error handling and validation
- CORS configuration for frontend integration

---

## Database Schema

Employee records contain:

- Name field
- Position field
- Level field
- Unique MongoDB ObjectId

---

## API Endpoints

- `GET /record` - Fetch all records
- `GET /record/:id` - Fetch single record
- `POST /record` - Create new record
- `PATCH /record/:id` - Update existing record
- `DELETE /record/:id` - Delete record

---

## File Structure

The project follows a standard MERN stack structure with separate client and server directories, organized components, and modular route handling.
