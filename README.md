Difference Between React, ReactJS, and React Native

- React and ReactJS are the same.
- ReactJS is just a more specific name for React.
- It is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces for web applications.
- React helps create reusable components and manage state effectively.

- React Native is a separate framework based on React.
- It is used to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript.
- Unlike React for web, React Native renders native mobile UI elements instead of HTML.

 - Use React or ReactJS when building web apps. 
  - Use React Native when building mobile apps.

 Is React a framework or a library? What is the difference?

- React is a library, not a framework.
- It focuses specifically on building user interfaces (UI) by creating reusable components.
- React handles the view layer in applications, giving developers flexibility to choose other tools for routing, state management, etc.

- A library offers specific functionality you can call when needed.
- A framework provides a complete structure and dictates how to build your app (more opinionated).

- In short:
 - React is a library because it gives flexibility and handles only part of the application (UI).
  - A framework would control more of the overall app architecture and flow.

Comparison: HTML vs JSX

- HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on web pages.
- JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used in React that looks like HTML,
- but allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript.

- Unlike HTML, JSX requires proper syntax (e.g., using className instead of class),
- and allows embedding JavaScript expressions using {}.

- Summary:
 - JSX is similar to HTML but is used within JavaScript code in React.
  - It lets you build UI components using a familiar syntax, with more dynamic capability.

---

What makes React attractive for our case?
- React is component-based, which makes it easy to build, reuse, and manage pieces of UI.
- It efficiently updates the UI using a virtual DOM, improving performance.
- React is also widely supported, has a strong community, and integrates well with other tools.

- Summary:
 - React is a good choice because it helps build fast, modular, and maintainable user interfaces,
  - which fits well with modern web application needs.

What are some alternative tech stacks?

- A tech stack is the combination of tools and technologies used to build an application.
- Alternatives to the React-based stack (like MERN) include:

- MEAN: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js
- JAMstack: JavaScript, APIs, and Markup (often using frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby)
- LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (commonly used for server-rendered apps)
- Django + React or Vue: Django (Python) backend with a modern JS frontend
- Ruby on Rails + Hotwire or React

- Summary:
 - There are many tech stacks available depending on project needs.
  - Alternatives include Angular-based, server-rendered, or static site stacks.

---

Why is MERN a good choice for full development?

- MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
- It's a full-stack JavaScript solution, meaning you can use one language (JavaScript)
- across the entire application â€“ frontend, backend, and database interactions.
- Each part of the stack is open-source, well-documented, and widely supported.
- React handles the frontend, Express and Node manage the backend, and MongoDB provides a flexible NoSQL database.

- Summary:
 - MERN is a good choice because it allows full-stack development using JavaScript,
  - offers strong performance, and supports rapid development with reusable components.

Provided two mern git hub links
- https://github.com/BenElferink/mern-template
 -I find this intresting because it uses passport js for authentication

- https://github.com/SEI-Remote/decoupled-mern-jwt-auth-template-back-end
 - I find this intersting because the creator uses JWT for code clean up
